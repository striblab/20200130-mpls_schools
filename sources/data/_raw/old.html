      <p>The four models look at how community schools and centralized magnets might have an impact on integration and improve student outcomes, modeling all elementary and middle schools as K-5 or 6-8s and swapping programs at Jefferson and Andersen.Under all of these models, the district is aiming to stem the flow of kids, reduce transportation costs and use the dollars saved for class instructions. Even with fewer magnets and tighter transportation routes, district leaders are convinced they would be able to offer about 1,000 more seats in those schools and help close the achievement gap between student groups.</p>

      <p>Models two and four, which are almost similar to each other focus on dual-language programs. The models recommend centralized bilingual programs in three community schools -- that are yet to be identified -- in parts of the city with the largest Spanish population.  But the difference between them is whether they are going to limit K-8 schools or not. Meanwhile, models three and five have an immersion focus. These models would eliminate Windom’s language immersion program, but would add a third K-5 Spanish immersion magnet at Green Central. The main difference between those models is whether or not they would have K-8 schools.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Current Alignment (Model One)</h2>
      <p>This model sticks to the current structure the district is operating under. But in order for the state’s third-largest school system to be operationally effective and keep spending in line, district leaders would need to close a “significant” number of underutilized schools, put an enrollment cap on over-enrolled schools and redraw school attendance zones in certain areas of the city. Under this plan, the district would have to change its Title 1 threshold from 40% to 60% or more. The district has identified about 13 schools with the largest drop in student enrollment and were targeted for support. At least 80% of the district’s under-enrolled schools are in the north and northeast. </p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Model Two</h2>
      <p>There would be no K-8 schools in model two. Instead, this option calls for reconfiguring grade-levels for elementary and middle schools and relocating magnets to the center of the city. This model adds a science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) program at Hall and Sullivan. Hall is currently a PYP school.  This model would drain potential savings for magnet schools, district leaders said. Andersen will be reconfigured into a STEAM middle school, while Jefferson would be a 6-8 dual-language immersion school, possibly the only in the state, according to district leaders.</p>
